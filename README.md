# Epsilon

[![Build status](https://github.com/TheGuardians/Epsilon/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TheGuardians/Epsilon/actions)

Epsilon was created out of the need for a GUI to inspect and edit Halo Online cache files, although it also supports any cache file that can be opened with TagTool.
